## TON SDK .NET Precompiled Libraries

Sources can be found here: https://github.com/radianceteam/ton-client-dotnet-bridge.

These binaries are automatically built and published as artifacts in the [ton-client-dotnet-bridge](https://github.com/radianceteam/ton-client-dotnet-bridge) repo.
Here, we store them because we need to easily run build/tests + need to use the specific version of the lib.
Also we pack them into NuGet package automatically.
